# =========================================================================== #
# THE PARTIAL-SOURCE POISONING LAW.
#
# When a target unit's sources are only PARTIALLY present in the data, the
# result for that unit is NA -- not a partial answer. The engine gets this
# from a right join against the crosswalk, which injects an NA row for every
# (identifier, source) pair the data does not carry.
#
# This is stated here on its own because it is the semantics most at risk from
# any performance rewrite of `.recast_pipeline()`: switching the right join to
# an inner join would turn every case below into a plausible-looking partial
# number, and no other test in the suite would notice. A wholly-missing group
# is NOT sufficient evidence -- `.recast_complete()` fills those with NA under
# either join type, so a test using one would pass either way.
# =========================================================================== #

# class G1 holds exactly U1 and U2. Supplying only U1 makes G1 PARTIAL, while
# G2 (U3, U4) and S1 (U5, U6) are wholly absent -- the two cases must be
# distinguished, so both appear here.
